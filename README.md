# IPOSGPT Retrieval Configuration Evaluation

This repository presents experimental results used to select the optimal retrieval strategy and LLM configuration for the IPOSGPT pipeline.

We compared RAG approaches and model backends to identify a retrieval setup that best balances relevance and response quality.
